# SnailBoard
Created in Visual Studio with Visual Micro plugin. Currently not really functional, being worked on to become a Planck-style keyboard (4x12 ortholinear).

I designed the keyboard, printed it, hand-wired it, and am now making its firmware from scratch. All files will available when it is fully functional.
